Design Patterns are general, reusable solutions to common problems encountered in software design. 

They are templates or best practices that developers can follow when solving similar types of issues in various situations. 

Design patterns streamline the development process by providing a proven template for solving a problem in a particular context, which can help ensure code is more readable, maintainable, and scalable.

## [Classification of Design Patterns](#classification-of-design-patterns)

Design patterns are typically categorized into three main types:

1. **[Creational Patterns:](CreationalPatterns/CreationalPatterns.md)** These deal with object creation mechanisms and aim to abstract or hide the instantiation process, making it easier to decouple code and provide greater flexibility in what gets created, how, and when.
Examples of creational patterns are -
      * [Singleton Pattern](CreationalPatterns/SingletonPattern.md)
      * [Factory Method Pattern](CreationalPatterns/FactoryMethodPattern.md)
      * [Abstract Factory Pattern](CreationalPatterns/AbstractFactoryPattern.md)
      * [Builder Pattern](CreationalPatterns/BuilderPattern.md)
      * [Prototype Pattern](CreationalPatterns/PrototypePattern.md)

2. **[Structural Patterns:](StructuralPatterns/StructuralPatterns.md)** These focus on class and object composition, defining relationships between entities to make them work together as a larger, flexible structure. They help organize classes and objects into more comprehensive and effective structures.

3. **[Behavioral Patterns:](BehavioralPatterns/BehavioralPatterns.md)** These deal with object interaction, communication, and responsibilities. Behavioral patterns help define the way objects collaborate and delegate responsibility, facilitating better management of complex flows and enabling greater flexibility.

Using these patterns can lead to more organized, efficient, and modular code, which is easier to test and maintain.
